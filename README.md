# Professional Portfolio — Starter

This is a lightweight, single-page professional portfolio scaffold you can customize.

Files
- `index.html` — main single-page portfolio with header, about, skills, projects and contact sections.
- `styles.css` — responsive styles.
- `script.js` — small JS for theme toggle, footer year and populating project cards.

Quick start
1. Open `professional-portfolio/index.html` in your browser (double-click) or use Live Server in VS Code for live reload.
2. Replace the placeholder text and the sample projects in `script.js` or directly inside `index.html`.
3. Contact form: open `index.html` and replace `YOUR_GMAIL_ADDRESS` inside the form `action` with your Gmail address (e.g. `https://formsubmit.co/you@gmail.com`).
   - Optionally change `_next` hidden input to a thank-you URL or remove it.
   - FormSubmit may ask you to verify the email once — follow their email to enable submissions.

Customization ideas
- Replace the hero image and project images.
- Add more accessible landmarks and ARIA attributes if you expand the UI.
- If you prefer self-hosted email, I can add a small Node/Express endpoint that sends emails via SMTP.

If you want, tell me the email to put into the form and I can update it for you.
